        <h1>Page Content</h1>
        <p>The main page content appears inside the <b>body</b> tag. HTML contains several elements tahat allow you to properly structure and format your content, which we'll cover later.</p>
        <h2>Content models</h2>
        <p>In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements. <b>Block level</b> elements would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while <b>inline level</b> elements typically appear within the flow of text content.</p>
        <p>In this example the <b>heading 1</b> and the <b>paragraphs</b> are block level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline level elements.</p>
        <p>In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML. There are seven main models: <b>Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning</b>. To learn more about them, visit the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#kinds-of-content">interactive graphic</a> contained in the W3C HTML5 specfication.</p>
<h2>Notes:</h2> 
<p><pre>What <i>am</i> I? vs. What <em>am</em> I? vs. Wnat <strong>am</strong> I?    </pre> Preformatted text, "pre tag" will display however you see it within the tags. the <b>i</b> tag is for italic in visual presentations. The <b>em</b> tag stands for emphasis and will appear in italics and change the intonation in a reader. <strong>strong</strong> is strongly emphasized and appears as bold.</p>

    <h2>Formatting page content</h2>
    In this series of exercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to format basic page content.
    <h3>Adding headings</h3>
    Headings help define the structure of the page and control the hierarchy of the content. You can use heading values ranging from a top-level heading of h1 all the way down to an h6. While there are several competing theories on the exact strategy to use when choosing headings, what really matters is that you are using them in an intelligent  manner, to accurately reflect the importance of your content. It's also important to be consistent in how you use headings across your site, so deciding on when and how to use headings is an important part of planning your site.
    <h3>Using paragraphs</h3>
    The paragraph tag (&lang;p&rang;) is one of the most basic formatting tags, and one that you'll use often. It indicates a paragraph of text, and should be used for each individual paragraph.
    <h3>Line breaks</h3>
    Occasionally you'll need to perform a "soft return," that is, create a new line without using a new paragraph. To do that in HTML, you use the line break tag (&lang;br&rang;). Line break tags are inline, meaning you can use them within headers and paragraphs, and don't require a closing tag. 
    Let's say you were formatting an address, for example. You could use line breaks to make sure each line of the address appeared on a separate line, but still remained within the same paragraph.

      <h2>Notes:</h2>
<p>Use headers to structure document, not to visually format the pages. Think about the overall structure of all pages when devising the hierarchy.</P>
<p>Use top level headings in a logical way for search engine optimization</p>
<p>Don't skip from h1 to h4</p>
